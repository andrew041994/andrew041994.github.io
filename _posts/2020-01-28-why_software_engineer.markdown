I've never considered myself to be an "*office*" person, or someone that sits behind a desk or computer all day, everyday. But when the opportunity was presented to me about learning programming language, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical but then I went online and started trying to learn a few things (html,css) and the more I did it the more I thought "hey, this isn't so bad". Then someone referred my to The Flatiron school and before I knew it I was enrolled and had started plucking away at the pre-work. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is doing this took me way outside my comfort zone, I mean so far out I can't even see my comfort zone anymore but in the end isn't that how greatness is created?. if you don't take that step, don't expect anything in your life to change, you have to be the one to make the change happen.
