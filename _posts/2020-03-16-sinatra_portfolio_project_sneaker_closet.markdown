### Project time is one again upon us. For my second project I had a little difficulty at the begining trying to decide what to make my project about until I was in my closet one day, looked up and saw all of my sneakers in boxes on the top shelf.

### "Man, it would be cool if I could see what I had without opening each box".... and just like that Sneaker Closet was born.

### I love that with each project I do it comes closer and closer to being something someone can actually use, being able to create something and have it displayed and funtion in a browser is absolutely amazing and I can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. For this project I created an MVC Sinatra application that can have users and users can have a collection of sneakers. Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) only the sneakers in their collection. This project required a lot more strategic thinking as opposed to the cli project due to all the moving parts and getting everything to flow and move as one package. But in the end it all came together and worked exactly how I envisioned it and cemented my understanding of databases, sinatra and mvc.
