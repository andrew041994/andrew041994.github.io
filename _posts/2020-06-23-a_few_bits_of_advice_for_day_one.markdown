### So I recently finished my final project and had some time to reflect back on my entire journey here at Flatiron school and just started thinking about a few things I wish I knew at the beginning of this course. One of the biggest pieces of advice I can give is try to stay at least 2 days ahead of the schedule, you'll have days where everything is going well and the solution to labs are just coming to you and everything makes sense, then you'll run into "that lab" you know, the one that makes you hate life. If you aren't ahead of your schedule that can consume a lot of your time and put you behind. Then maybe you'll run into another and another and before you know it, you're three days behind schedule and you've got a portfolio project coming due. Things can go very smooth and then not so smooth in the blink of an eye, that's why having that buffer will be you're best friend.

### This brings me to my next point which is.... use the "ask a question" feature when you're stuck. At first i was shy about that because I didn't want the answers given to me, but after using it I quickly realized it was more of a  "point you in the right direction" rather than just saying hey this is what you need to do, so definitely make use of it to save yourself some headaches.

### Your fellow classmates are a great resource. Twice I've been stuck on labs and codded along with fellow classmates to get it solved. This does two things, it builds camaraderie with fellow students in your cohort and more importantly developers a team atmosphere which is more reflective of the real world developer life.

### Last but not least. Get your environment on your local machine set up as soon as possible. This will save you a lot of time and hassle in the long run when its crunch time. and also its very beneficial to start coding in your environment rather than using the in browser ide. You'll want to get used to this early on since you won't be using an in browser ide in the real world. I use visual studio code and I love it but I've head good things about sublime and atom, either way they're all text editors and accomplish the same task so its user preference I guess. I hope this helps someone.
