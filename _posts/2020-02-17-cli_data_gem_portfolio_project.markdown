This is the first project of my course and I have to say it truly tested everything I have learned so far (well, maybe not *everything* but it sure tested a lot ). At first I kept hitting walls after walls trying to get my environment set up and connecting  it to github, but once that was done I was off to start coding. And then.... "what website should I scrape?",
believe it or not this was a hard part for me so I started thinking about something I might like to use and being a marvel fan I decided to scrape a site that has info on marvel characters, displaying their character name, full name and a little info about them. In the end after hrs and hrs, days and days of coding I produced an app I could be proud of, it behaves the way I want it to and doesn't break no matter what the user inputs they get a return message. Excited to see what comes next.
